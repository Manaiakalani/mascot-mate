# mascot-mate

> Your friendly browser-side desktop assistant. Like Clippy, but
> well-behaved on a 4K display and powered by an LLM you trust.

`mascot-mate` is a tiny embeddable web widget that drops a fully animated
mascot into the corner of any page, lets the visitor ask questions, and
streams answers back from your own OpenAI-compatible proxy. It ships with
three mascots out of the box, a click to swap between them, and a click on
the speech-bubble to ask away.

## ✨ Features

- **3 swappable mascots** with full sprite-sheet animation engines (idle
  rotation, greeting, thinking, explain, celebrate, alert).
- **Streaming answers** — Server-Sent Events from a tiny Node proxy that
  keeps your OpenAI key server-side.
- **Drag to reposition** with localStorage persistence.
- **Defaults to bottom-right** across desktop, tablet, mobile, iOS notches,
  and Android gesture bars (uses `env(safe-area-inset-*)`).
- **Accessible** — `role=dialog` bubble with focus trap + ESC, `aria-live`
  streaming text, keyboard shortcuts (Enter / Space on the mascot, `/` to
  focus), reduced-motion support, axe-core clean (no critical/serious
  violations).
- **Robust error handling** — typed errors (`rate_limit` / `unauthorized`
  / `network` / `timeout` / `server` / `aborted`), inline retry button,
  per-kind friendly copy, structured `{error, kind}` envelopes from the
  proxy.
- **Hardened proxy** — CORS allow-list, per-IP token-bucket rate limit,
  payload + message-count caps, no key in browser, ever.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manaiakalani/mascot-mate.git
cd mascot-mate
cp .env.example .env             # add your OPENAI_API_KEY
npm install
npm run dev:server               # proxy on :8787
npm run dev:widget               # demo page on :5174
```

Open <http://localhost:5174>, click the mascot, ask anything.

## 📦 Embedding on any site

Build the widget:

```bash
cd widget && npm run build
```

Host `widget/dist/mascot.iife.js` on any CDN, then drop one tag:

```html
<script src="https://your-cdn.example/mascot.iife.js"
        data-endpoint="https://your-proxy.example/api/ask"
        data-mascot="clippy"
        data-greeting="Hi! Ask me anything."
        defer></script>
```

The widget auto-mounts, persists the user's mascot choice in
`localStorage`, and exposes a programmatic API:

```js
window.Mascot.switchTo('ninjacat');     // or 'clippy' | 'bob'
window.Mascot.ask('Explain CSS box-sizing in one sentence.');
window.Mascot.hide();
window.Mascot.show();
```

## 🔌 Configuration

### Server (env vars)

| Var                 | Default        | Notes                                        |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`    | (required)     | Your OpenAI key. Stays server-side.          |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`      | `gpt-4o-mini`  | Any chat-completions model id.               |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`   | `*`            | Comma-separated CORS allow-list, or `*`.     |
| `RATE_LIMIT_RPM`    | `20`           | Requests per minute, per IP (token bucket).  |
| `PORT`              | `8787`         |                                              |

### Widget (`<script>` data-attrs)

| Attribute         | Notes                                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `data-endpoint`   | URL of `/api/ask`. Required for auto-mount.    |
| `data-mascot`     | `clippy` (default) / `ninjacat` / `bob`.       |
| `data-greeting`   | Initial speech-bubble text.                    |
| `data-system`     | System prompt sent to the model.               |

## 🎨 Adding a mascot

A mascot is a folder following the **ClippyJS sprite-sheet format**:

```
widget/src/mascots/<id>/
  ├─ map.json    # framesize, overlayCount, animations
  └─ map.png     # horizontal sprite strip
```

Validate before shipping:

```bash
cd widget && npm run validate-mascot -- src/mascots/<id>
```

Animation names the widget looks for (with sensible fallbacks):
`Greeting`, `GoodBye`, `Thinking`, `Explain`, plus any `^Idle*` for the
auto-rotation pool.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
cd widget
npm test                         # unit tests (vitest)

# Playwright fit-and-finish suites:
node scripts/fit-finish.mjs      # mascot swap, pill, bubble, edges
node scripts/drag-check.mjs      # pointer drag + persistence
node scripts/error-check.mjs     # 429 / 401 / network / SSE-error
node scripts/a11y-check.mjs      # axe-core + keyboard flow
node scripts/anchor-check.mjs    # bottom-right across viewports
node scripts/idle-check.mjs      # idle scheduler fires
node scripts/size-parity-check.mjs  # all 3 mascots ≈ same size
```

The proxy has its own unit tests in `server/`:

```bash
cd server && npm test
```

## 🤔 Why a proxy?

Putting your OpenAI key in the browser is a one-way ticket to a six-figure
bill. The included `server/` is a tiny Node 20+ service (~150 lines, zero
runtime deps) that:

- streams chat completions from OpenAI as SSE tokens,
- enforces a CORS allow-list,
- rate-limits per IP via token bucket,
- caps payload + message count,
- emits typed JSON envelopes (`{ error, kind }`) so the widget can render
  per-error-kind UI.

Deploy it anywhere Node 20+ runs (Vercel, Fly, Render, Railway, etc.).

## 🙋 About me

Built by [@Manaiakalani](https://github.com/Manaiakalani) over a few
evenings as a love letter to the late-90s desktop assistants — the kind
that once asked if you were writing a letter, except this one actually
helps. No telemetry, no tracking, no analytics; just a smile in the
corner of your page.
